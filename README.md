# Vehicle-Detection-Tracking-and-Speed-Estimation-Based-on-Deep-Learning-Yolov7
model consists of three main phases: Detection phase, tracking phase, and speed calculation phase:
We employ the YOLOV7 for detection,and for tracking we use the DeepSORT algorithm to assign IDs 
for vehicles and track them.
to calculate speed of moving objects, we need the distance between two points



## Steps to run the code 
### the work environment
Google clabe : you need to creat a new notebook.

- Clone  the repostory 
```
git clone https://github.com/WalidDa10/Vehicle-Detection-Tracking-and-Speed-Estimation-Based-on-Deep-Learning-Yolov7.git
```
- Install the dependecies
To install required dependencies run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
